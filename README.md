( Edd G et al., 2022)
5.1. Quantitative Analysis:
The quantitative data collected through surveys revealed several key insights. Firstly, the majority of participants (72%) acknowledged the potential benefits of AI in improving efficiency and productivity in programming tasks. They highlighted the ability of AI to automate repetitive processes, generate code snippets, and assist in bug detection. However, a significant proportion (48%) expressed concerns about the impact of AI on job security, as they believed it could potentially replace certain programming tasks in the future.

In terms of the limitations of AI in programming and development, the quantitative data indicated that 58% of participants identified the lack of human creativity and intuition as a major drawback. They emphasized the importance of human expertise in problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making, which AI may struggle to replicate. Additionally, 42% of participants expressed apprehension regarding the ethical implications of AI in programming, particularly in areas such as bias, privacy, and data security.
5.2. Qualitative Analysis:
The qualitative analysis of the interview data further enriched our understanding of the pros and cons of AI in programming and development. The interviews provided deeper insights into the nuanced perspectives of industry experts. From the interviews, it became evident that while AI offers significant advantages in terms of automating mundane tasks and accelerating development processes, it still falls short in handling complex and creative aspects of programming.
5.3. My Point of View:
As an expert in IT and AI technologies, I share the view that AI can indeed enhance programming and development processes by automating repetitive tasks and improving efficiency. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving human creativity, intuition, and critical thinking. AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human programmers. Ethical considerations, such as addressing biases and ensuring data privacy, should also be given due attention in the integration of AI technologies.
5.4. Subgroup Analysis:
A subgroup analysis was conducted based on the participants' years of experience. Interestingly, it was observed that participants with more experience (>10 years) were more skeptical about the potential benefits of AI in programming, whereas those with fewer years of experience (<5 years) showed greater enthusiasm and optimism. This divergence of opinions highlights the need for further research and exploration in understanding the impact of AI in programming across different experience levels.

In summary, the results of this study indicate a mixed perception of AI in programming and development. While it offers advantages in terms of efficiency and productivity, concerns about job security, creativity limitations, and ethical considerations exist. These findings emphasize the importance of a balanced approach in integrating AI technologies and the need for ongoing dialogue and exploration in this rapidly evolving field.
